@-Part-1: Contact_List_MauiProject

The Contact_List_MauiProject is a project hosted on my GitHub repository. It aims to create a user-friendly contact list application using the Maui framework.



@-Part-2: Advanced Functionality for Maui Project without API

In the Maui project, we are implementing additional advanced functionalities to enhance communication capabilities:

1-Calling: Users can initiate phone calls directly from the contact list application, making it convenient to stay connected with their contacts.

2-Email: Integration of email functionality allows users to compose and send emails to their contacts without leaving the app.

3-Messaging: The app enables users to send text messages or instant messages to their contacts seamlessly.

4-Communication Details: We are providing a comprehensive view of communication details for each contact, including call logs, email history, and message threads.

By adding these advanced communication features, our Maui project will become a versatile tool for managing contacts and maintaining seamless communication with friends, family, and colleagues.
